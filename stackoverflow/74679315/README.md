# Overview

The notebook in this directory as background research [this answer][answer] to [the
question][question] about high training accuracy with low test accuracy of LeNet
(Convolutional Neural Network) on the [MNIST][mnist] dataset.

I also have various [other implementations of LeNet][lenet] in my machine learning
repo, including an implementation of the Subsampling layer.
