# Reimplementing ML papers

This directory holds a subset of my project which aims to [reimplement ML
papers][reimplementing-ml-papers], specifically, the tooling around simplifying
and cleaning up Jupyter notebooks and testing them to ensure they stay that way.

The file [`refresh-files.sh`](refresh-files.sh) downloads the latest versions of
the necessary files for the functionality to be used in this repo, and something
you can use yourself if you need the same functionality.

To see how this is used, see the [top-level `Makefile`](../../Makefile) in this
repo.
